# ie_mbd_sept23
Repository for the group projects of IE MBD Algo Trading SEPT 23

## Instructions
- create a different folder for each of the groups
- all projects should have a separation between the library used for the code (e.g. a class that contains the algo) and a notebook where this is imported and used with examples of data that can be run
- you should create a branch to work on your individual project and merge when you want to integrate with the main libray (you will need to use the simulator and the matching engine / backtesting from two of the groups if you are working on a trading algorithm)
